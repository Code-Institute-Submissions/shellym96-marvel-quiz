## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate my HTML files.
See link below:

- https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fshellym96.github.io%2Fmarvel-quiz%2Findex.html


| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.
See link below:
- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fshellym96.github.io%2Fmarvel-quiz


| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |

## Responsiveness

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.

| Device | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsive-mobile.png) | Works as expected |
| Tablet (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsive-tablet.png) | Works as expected |
| Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/responsive-desktop.png) | Works as expected |

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Everything came back very well which I'm happy about.

## Bugs

- My first bug I came across was when I started to do script.js. I had done my start-button in html and css, but when I tried to put the button to use to start the quiz and it would not work , although I had started the javascript. I had exhausted options I knew of, and checked google until I had to contact student support and they helped me figure out the bug that was in the css. There was a display flex taking priority so I added display:none !important , to my button and that done the job. | Corrected |

- Secondly my questions wouldn't appear , after examining my code closely until I realised I had my function for the questions spelled incorrectly. Once this was corrected the questions appeared. | Corrected |


## Unfixed Bugs

Bugs that have not been fixed would be in responsiveness.

- On a physical mobile phone rather than DevTools, the entire screen shrunk up to the very top.

- On a physical mobile phone, when user clicked a button the hover inset colour effect would remain in position for next question. See example below : before that question I had clicked the bottom left button and then the highlight remained there, I am assuming this is because the mobile device does not show the mouse, and technically the mouse is hovering over the button itself.

Other than the bugs I have mentioned, there are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
